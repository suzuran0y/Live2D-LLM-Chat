> **Live2D + ASR + LLM + TTS** → Real-time voice interaction | Local deployment / Cloud inference

---
## 1. Project Introduction

**Live2D-LLM-Chat** is a real-time AI interaction project that integrates **Live2D virtual avatars**, **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)**, **Large Language Models (LLM)**, and **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**. It allows a **virtual character** to recognize the user's speech through ASR, generate intelligent responses using AI, synthesize speech via TTS, and drive Live2D animations with lip-sync for a natural interaction experience.

---
### 1.1. Main Features
- **Automatic Speech Recognition（ASR）**: Uses FunASR for Speech-to-Text (STT) processing.
- **Large Language Model（LLM）**: Supports rational conversation using OpenAI GPT / DeepSeek.
- **Text-to-Speech（TTS）**: Uses CosyVoice for high-quality speech synthesis.
- **Live2D Virtual Character Interaction**: Renders models using Live2D SDK and enables real-time feedback.

---
### 1.2. Enhanced Features
- **LLM module** supports both local and cloud deployment. The local deployment is based on **LM Studio**, which covers all open-source models, but personal device performance may limit large - models. Cloud deployment supports **OpenAI** and **DeepSeek** APIs.
- Stores conversation history with **context memory**. Every five conversations, a summary is generated to prevent excessive text accumulation.
- **Conversation logging** records the timestamp and dialogue history, including **TTS audio outputs**, making it easy to review past interactions. This feature can be disabled in the config file to **reduce memory usage**.
- Enhanced Live2D **eye-tracking** and **blinking logic** to provide natural blinking even if the Live2D model lacks built-in logic. Implements **lip-sync mechanics** by analyzing real-time audio volume from the TTS output.
- Modifies CosyVoice API to **directly save** generated speech files and **merge** segmented audio for long text synthesis.

---
## 4. Configuration for Local Setup（important！！）

---

### 4.1. Configure ASR & TTS Models

After installing **ASR** and **TTS** models, follow these steps for local configuration:

**Replace SenseVoice Directory**
- Move the downloaded **SenseVoice** folder into `Live2D-LLM-Chat/ASR_env/`, replacing the existing empty folder.

**Replace CosyVoice Directory**
- Move the downloaded **CosyVoice** folder into `Live2D-LLM-Chat/TTS_env/`, replacing the existing empty folder.

**Replace `webui.py` File**
- Move the `TTS_env/webui.py` file into the `CosyVoice` folder, replacing the original `webui.py` file.

---

### 4.2. Configure `config.py` for Local Environment
Modify **`config.py`** to adjust local file paths and parameters. Example:
```python
class Config:
    # Project Root Directory
    PROJECT_ROOT = "E:/PyCharm/project/project1"

    # ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) Configuration
    ASR_MODEL_DIR = os.path.join(PROJECT_ROOT, "ASR_env/SenseVoice/models/SenseVoiceSmall")
    ASR_AUDIO_INPUT = os.path.join(PROJECT_ROOT, "ASR_env/input_voice/voice.wav")

    # TTS (Text-to-Speech) Configuration
    TTS_API_URL = "http://localhost:8000/"
    TTS_OUTPUT_DIR = os.path.join(PROJECT_ROOT, "TTS_env/output_voice/")

```
**Ensure all paths are correctly set up before running the project!**

---
## 4.3. Configure LLM Model

Local deployment of the **LLM model** relies on **LM Studio**. Follow these steps:

#### 1. Install LM Studio
Download from [GitHub](https://github.com/lmstudio-ai) or the [LM Studio official website](https://lmstudio.ai/).

#### 2. Open the application and download an LLM model compatible with your device.
Start LM Studio and obtain the local API URL.
Adjust the model path & port number in `config.py`.

#### 3. Run the local LLM and integrate it into the project.
**Note**: The performance of locally deployed LLM models depends on device capabilities and may not match cloud-based models. If higher performance is required, consider using OpenAI GPT-4 or DeepSeek API.

---
## 5. Usage Instructions
---

## 5.1. Start the TTS AP

Before running the main program, **start the TTS API**:

```bash
python TTS_api.py  # This is now integrated into the main program but can be run separately for debugging.
```

The TTS API module will run `webui.py` in the **conda environment**. Once successfully started, you can access the WebUI for voice synthesis management: Default address: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

Ensure the **TTS API is running properly**, or the program will not be able to generate speech.

---
### 5.2. Run the Main Program

Once the TTS API is started, run the main program:

```bash
python main.py
```

**Interaction Steps**:

1. **Press and hold the Ctrl key** to start recording, **press the Alt key** to stop recording. The voice will be automatically converted into text.
2. The **text is processed by the LLM module**, generating a response.
3. The **response text is converted into speech** via the TTS module, and the Live2D model will sync its lip movements to the speech.
